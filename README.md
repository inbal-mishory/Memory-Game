Memory-Game
===========

an HTML5, CSS3, SVG, and Javascript based memory game.

This game was made as the final project for an HTML5 course at the "Netcraft Accademy".
My goal was to bring into the game as many of the new technologies and APIs that I'd learned 
during the course as possible. 

With emphasis on an intuitive user interface, with a (hopefully) good design easthetic.
I wanted my kids to be able to play this on the tablet, which has been acheived, so, "dream come true", 
thank you very much.

The process was very challanging to me as I had never before created something from scratch, so to speak,
I've allways worked with graphic designers, server side programmers, and content providers in my creation
process.

I used the HTML5 logo and an SVG element of an HTML5 class for the cards two faces, and a background echoing
the one on http://www.w3.org/html/logo/. for rights purposes, i made that PNG myself.

Currently working on adding a jquery layer to it and expanding on device compatibility.
